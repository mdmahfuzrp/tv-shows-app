**Dear Hiring Team,** <br>
I have created a TV show app with separate cards for each show on the home page, including a banner. The cards display the show's name, picture, and a "Show Details" button. After Clicking on the button takes you to a details page where you can find specific details about the show.

- On the show details page, you can view various details and "Book Movie Ticket" button. After clicking this button a form modal will open with some extra show details and asking for confirmation to book the show.

- If confirmed, the show's data will be saved in local storage.

- There is also a "My Bookings" page where you can view your booked shows.

- Let me know if you have any questions!
